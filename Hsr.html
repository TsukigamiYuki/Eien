        <div class="desc">The Astral Express, also called by the Xianzhou Alliance as the Chromatic Echelon,is a large train that serves as one of the main settings of Honkai: Star Rail. It was created by Akivili, the Aeon of Trailblaze, and used to transport THEM and the Nameless across the galaxy. After Akivili's disappearance, it fell into disrepair and eventually crash-landed onto an unnamed planet. Himeko discovered the wreckage and repaired the Express, becoming its navigator and forming a new Astral Express Crew. Their current goal is to retrace Akivili's steps, repairing the star rail THEY laid down thousands of years ago and sealing the Stellarons threatening the galaxy. The Astral Express is not treated as its own world in Navigation, but is instead accessible from every world's area list. Currently, three cars can be accessed in-game: the Parlor Car, Party Car, and the Passenger Cabin. A buffet car has been mentioned, but has not been seen.</div>
